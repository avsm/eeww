is a small library exposing only one functionality: spawning sub-process.\n\nIt has three main goals:\n\n1. provide missing features of Unix.create_process such as providing a\nworking directory\n\n2. provide better errors when a system call fails in the\nsub-process. For instance if a command is not found, you get a proper\n[Unix.Unix_error] exception\n\n3. improve performance by using vfork when available. It is often\nclaimed that nowadays fork is as fast as vfork, however in practice\nfork takes time proportional to the process memory while vfork is\nconstant time.
